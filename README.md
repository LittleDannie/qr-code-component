## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I basically learnt how to use markdown, how to write it and the syntax used.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out  to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning flexbox and master it to the fullest before moving to css gridbox

### Useful resources

- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me write my README.md file
